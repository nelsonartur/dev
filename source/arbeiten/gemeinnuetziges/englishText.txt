<mark>As individuals and as an art and cultural association, we would be nothing without those sisters and brothers who struggle with institutional racism every day. Worldwide discrimination and racism, of which the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis is only the tip of the iceberg, is never just a problem for those affected. We are privileged to address systematic grievances - especially in Germany - and demand change.<br><br>We have used our platform to collect donations for the association "ADEFRA" and the "Black Lives Matter" movement by selling a T-shirt designed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/808textil/" target="_blank">808TEXTIL</a>. The entire profit of the campaign went to both organisations. The shirt is a tribute to Bashar Barakah Jackson, better known as Pop Smoke, and the hiphop culture of the 1990s, who died far too young this year. The music of Pop Smoke, who was considered a follower of the African-American civil rights activist Malcolm X, has been heard at protests throughout the USA in recent months. His murder in February has still not been solved by the police. </mark>
